{"name":"Openspecs","tagline":"Protocol specifications for the Open Name System","body":"### The Open Name System\r\n\r\nThe Open Name System (or ONS) is a protocol that builds on top of the domain name system and provides the additional functionality of the resolution of usernames to user identities.\r\n\r\nUser identities are represented as JSON data, and username-to-user-data mappings are stored in a decentralized key-value store.\r\n\r\nAny KV store may have multiple namespaces, and currently the Namecoin blockchain is home to the largest namespace in existence.\r\n\r\n### opendig\r\n\r\n\"opendig\" is a command line tool that extends the functionality of dig to support the resolution of usernames. opendig supports all dig calls, as well as username-specific calls.\r\n\r\n##### opendig user data\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ opendig -u justin\r\n\r\n{\r\n    \"name\": {\r\n        \"formatted\": \"Justin Kan\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"website\": \"http://justinkan.com\",\r\n    \"bitcoin\": {\r\n        \"address\": \"1Jf5u4LiYuN3S5Fhj1At7fooSbPhQSMk8j\"\r\n    },\r\n    ...\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### opendig bitcoin data\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ opendig bitcoin -u justin\r\n\r\n{\r\n    \"address\": \"1Jf5u4LiYuN3S5Fhj1At7fooSbPhQSMk8j\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### user schema\r\n\r\nONS and opendig currently use the v0.2 user-schema, but a new standard (v0.3) is being developed, which is in the RFC phase. After sufficient people have reviewed, commented on, and revised the v0.3 schema, a rollout of the new version will begin.\r\n\r\n##### v0.2\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n\"name\": {\r\n    \"formatted\": \"Ryan Shea\"\r\n},\r\n\"bitcoin\": {\r\n    \"address\": \"14eautXfJT7EZsKfm1eHSAPnHkn3w1XF9R\"\r\n},\r\n\"twitter\": {\r\n    \"username\": \"ryaneshea\",\r\n    \"proof\": {\r\n        \"url\": \"https://twitter.com/ryaneshea/status/486057647808868352\"\r\n    }\r\n},\r\n\"v\": \"0.2\",\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### v0.3\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n\"basics\": {\r\n    \"name\": \"Ryan Shea\",\r\n    \"location\": \"New York, NY\",\r\n},\r\n\"payments\": [\r\n    { \"type\": \"bitcoin\", \"address\": \"14eautXfJT7EZsKfm1eHSAPnHkn3w1XF9R\" },\r\n],\r\n\"profiles\": [\r\n    { \"type\": \"twitter\", \"username\": \"ryaneshea\",\r\n      \"proof\": \"https://twitter.com/ryaneshea/status/486057647808868352\" },\r\n],\r\n\"v\": \"0.3\",\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe list of contributors continues to grow and all are welcome.
